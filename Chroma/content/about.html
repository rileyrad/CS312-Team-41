                I'm a third-year CSU student studying computer science. My passions reside in 
                coding, playing guitar, climbing, and skateboarding. My goal is to learn more 
                about the industry through this class in order to have a better chance at 
                getting an internship and a job outside of college.

                I'm a current CS student attending Colorado State University. Some passions
                of mine are mountain biking, skiing, hiking, and I am getting more into fishing.
                Web Development is an important topic of study for CS students, and I hope to leave
                this class with a strong foundation in that field.
